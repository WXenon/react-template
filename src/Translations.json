The gas concept helped to distinguish between the actual value of the ETH crypto and the cost of computational power used to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Over time, gas fees in crypto have become a synonym for network fees charged to users to validate transactions on other blockchains.",

It is fundamental when determining and analyzing the potentials of a cryptocurrency in order to have higher chances of making more money and profits from these projects rather than losing your investments."
